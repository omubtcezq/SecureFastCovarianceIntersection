\begin{abstract}

Fast covariance intersection is a widespread technique for state estimate fusion in sensor networks when cross-correlations are not known and fast computations are desired. The common requirement of sending estimates from one party to another during fusion means they do not remain private to their producing party. Current secure fusion algorithms have a reliance on encryption schemes that do not provide sufficient flexibility and as a result require, often undesired, excess communication between estimate producers. We propose a novel method of homomorphically computing the fast covariance intersection algorithm on estimates encrypted with a combination of encryption schemes. Using order revealing encryption we show how the approximate solutions to the fast covariance intersection coefficients can be computed and combined with partially homomorphic encryptions of estimates, to compute an encryption of the fused result. The described approach allows the secure fusion of any number of private estimates, making third-party cloud processing a viable option when working with sensitive state estimates, or when performing estimation over insecure networks.

\section{Introduction}
Sensor data processing and state estimation have been increasingly prevalent in networked systems \cite{hallDistributedDataFusion2012,chongFortyYearsDistributed2017}. Bayesian state estimation has become a particularly common application since the beginning of Kalman estimation theory \cite{kalmanNewApproachLinear1960} and has led to a large interest in the field of state estimation fusion \cite{willnerKalmanFilterAlgorithms1977,chongHIERARCHICALESTIMATION,chongDistributedTrackingDistributed1986,hashemipourDecentralizedStructuresParallel1988,grimeDataFusionDecentralized1994}. Challenges of estimation fusion are closely tied to the handling and merging of estimation error statistics \cite{fouratiMultisensorDataFusion2017}. Cross-correlation between estimation errors characterise dependencies between local estimates and must be considered when performing consistent or optimal fusion \cite{bar-shalomTracktotrackCorrelationProblem1981,sunMultisensorOptimalInformation2004}. Methods that keep track of the cross-correlation of errors omit the need for repeated reconstruction \cite{steinbringOptimalSamplebasedFusion2016} however typically add local computational complexity and limit usability. An alternative strategy sees the approximation of estimate error cross-correlation based on conservative suboptimal strategies, and has been implemented in a variety of methods \cite{carlsonFederatedFilterFaulttolerant1988,julierNondivergentEstimationAlgorithm,sijsStateFusionUnknown2010,noackInverseCovarianceIntersection2017,niehsenInformationFusionBased2002,frankenImprovedFastCovariance2005}. Covariance Intersection (CI) \cite{julierNondivergentEstimationAlgorithm} provides one such popular conservative strategy, from which a less computationally expensive method, the Fast Covariance Intersection (FCI) \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002} has been derived. CI is particularly well paired with the information form of the Kalman filter \cite{mutambaraDecentralizedEstimationControl2019}. This algebraically equivalent form of the standard Kalman filter requires the persistent storing of the information matrix and vector instead of the usual state estimate and covariance and reduces fusion operations to simple summations. It has been used to subtract common information between estimates when cross-correlations are known \cite{grimeDataFusionDecentralized1994} and within fully distributed filter implementations \cite{pfaffInformationFormDistributed2017}.

A key step in distributed sensor fusion, and our topic of interest in this paper, is the requirement of transmitting sensor state estimate information between network nodes for the computation of a final fused result. Network eavesdroppers or curious fusion nodes are not prevented from learning possibly sensitive local state estimates and errors. Encryption has until recently been primarily used to secure information transfer between communicating parties, with common symmetric-key encryption schemes such as AES \cite{AnnouncingAdvancedEncryption2001} being used to encrypt sent information to its destination, and public-key encryption schemes such as RSA \cite{rivestMethodObtainingDigital1978} to distribute symmetric keys. However, recent developments in public-key homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes \cite{gentryFullyHomomorphicEncryption2009,elgamalPublicKeyCryptosystem1985,paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999}, which allow algebraic operations to be performed on encryptions, are leading to more secure cloud or network applications for signal processing \cite{lagendijkEncryptedSignalProcessing2013,alexandruEncryptedCooperativeControl,aristovEncryptedMultisensorInformation2018}. Although implementations of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes exist \cite{gentryImplementingGentryFullyHomomorphic2011}, and provide all algebraic operations on encryptions, current implementations are still computationally infeasible for large-scale signal processing \cite{duImplementingMLAlgorithms,acarSurveyHomomorphicEncryption2018}. Instead, Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) schemes \cite{elgamalPublicKeyCryptosystem1985,paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999}, providing typically only one algebraic operation, have been a focus for such processing tasks \cite{alexandruEncryptedCooperativeControl,aristovEncryptedMultisensorInformation2018}. However, due to the limited operations provided by PHE (most commonly addition provided by the Paillier encryption scheme due to its speed and simplicity, \cite{paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999}), securely computable processing algorithms have thus far been relatively restricted in complexity and application. The recent development of new encryption schemes, such as Order Revealing Encryption (ORE) \cite{chenettePracticalOrderRevealingEncryption2016,lewiOrderRevealingEncryptionNew2016,bogatovComparativeEvaluationOrderPreserving}, have provided new light on the possible complexity of signal processing algorithms that can be computed securely. Thus far, ORE has found little application in the context of signal processing algorithms or in combination with HE schemes. In this paper, we make use of a combination of ORE and PHE schemes to develop a Secure FCI (SecFCI) fusion approximation method that enables us to protect sensor estimates from both eavesdroppers and other algorithm participants.

In section \ref{sec:ci} we will introduce CI and FCI methods relevant to our proposed fusion algorithm, and in section \ref{sec:encryption}, the relevant encryption schemes. Sections \ref{sec:secfci} and \ref{sec:multi_secfci} will introduce the secure FCI algorithm for the 2 sensor and multi-sensor cases respectively, and \ref{sec:results} discusses simulation results and comparisons to the ordinary FCI fusion algorithm. We conclude our findings and plans for future work in \ref{sec:conclusion}.


\subsection{Notation}
Throughout this paper we will use the following notation. Lowercase characters represent scalars, lowercase underlined characters, $\vec{x}$, represent vectors. Uppercase bold characters, $\mM$, are reserved for matrices, where $\mM^\top$ denotes the matrix transpose, $\mM^{-1}$ the matrix inverse, and $\tr(\cdot)$ the trace function. Covariance matrices will be represented by the matrix $\mP$. $\mathcal{E}_{pk}(a)$ and $\mathcal{E}_{ORE,k}(a)$ denote the public-key $pk$ and ORE key $k$ encryptions of $a$, and similarly with the decryption functions $\mathcal{D}_{pk}(\cdot)$ and $\mathcal{D}_{ORE,k}(\cdot)$, where any required real-number encodings of the number $a$ are assumed to be performed. $\mathcal{E}(a)$ and $\mathcal{E}_{ORE}(a)$ may be used for brevity when the encryption keys can be inferred from context. All encryption of vectors and matrices are defined element-wise, with elements given by $\mathcal{E}(\mP_{i,j}) = \mathcal{E}(\mP)_{i,j}$. Sets are represented as $\{\cdot\}$ while ordered lists with $[\cdot]$.

\section{Covariance Intersection and Approximations} \label{sec:ci}
Covariance Intersection (CI), introduced in \cite{julierNondivergentEstimationAlgorithm}, provides a consistent state estimation fusion algorithm when model cross-correlations are not known. The resulting fused estimate $\mean{\vec{x}}$ and estimate covariance $\mP$ can be easily derived from its equations
\begin{equation}
   \mP^{-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\omega_i \mP_i^{-1} \label{eqn:ci_cov}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   \mP^{-1} \mean{\vec{x}} =\sum_{i=0}^{n}\omega_i \mP_i^{-1} \mean{\vec{x}}_i\,. \label{eqn:ci_estimate}
\end{equation}
Note that \eqref{eqn:ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate} compute the fusion of the information matrix and vectors as defined in \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002} and reduce the fusion to a simple weighted sum.
Values for $\omega_i$ must satisfy
\begin{equation}
   \omega_0 + \omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_n = 1 \label{eqn:ci_omega_sum}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   0 \leq \omega_i \leq 1\,. \label{eqn:ci_omega_bound}
\end{equation}
and guarantee consistency of the fused estimates. They are chosen in a way to speed up convergence, by minimising a property of the resulting fused estimate covariance. One such property which may be minimised to guarantee faster convergence is the fused estimate covariance trace, requiring the solution to
\begin{equation}
   \argmin_{\omega_0,\dots,\omega_n} \{\tr(\mP)\} = \argmin_{\omega_0,\dots,\omega_n} \{\tr((\sum_{i=0}^{n}\omega_i \mP_i)^{-1})\}\,. \label{eqn:ci_trace_min}
\end{equation}
However, minimising this non-linear cost function can be very costly computationally and has led to the development of the non-iterative approximation technique in \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002}.


\subsection{Fast Covariance intersection}
The Fast Covariance Intersection (FCI) algorithm from \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002} is a common method used for approximating the solution to \eqref{eqn:ci_trace_min} without the loss of guaranteed consistency. It is computed by defining a new constraint
\begin{equation}
   \omega_i \tr(\mP_i) - \omega_j \tr(\mP_j) = 0,\ (i,j=1,2,\dots,n) \label{eqn:fci_eq_big}
\end{equation}
on $\omega_i$ and solving the resulting equations instead. In the two sensor case, this results in the solving of
\begin{equation}
   \omega_0 + \omega_1 = 1 \label{eqn:fci_2sen_omega_sum}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   \omega_0 \tr(\mP_0) - \omega_1 \tr(\mP_1) = 0\,, \label{eqn:fci_2sen_eq}
\end{equation}
with analytical solutions given by
\begin{equation}
   \omega_0 = \frac{\tr(\mP_1)}{\tr(\mP_0)+\tr(\mP_1)},\ \omega_1 = \frac{\tr(\mP_0)}{\tr(\mP_0)+\tr(\mP_1)}\,. \label{eqn:fci_2sen_sol}
\end{equation}
When computed for the $n$ sensor case, the highly redundant \eqref{eqn:fci_eq_big} can have its largest linearly independent subset represented by
\begin{equation}
   \omega_i \tr(\mP_i) - \omega_{i+1} \tr(\mP_{i+1}) = 0,\ (i=1,2,\dots,n)\,, \label{eqn:fci_eq}
\end{equation}
and requires the solution to the linear problem
\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      \mathcal{P}_0 & -\mathcal{P}_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
      0 & \mathcal{P}_1 & -\mathcal{P}_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \\
      0 & \cdots & 0 & \mathcal{P}_{n-1} & -\mathcal{P}_n \\
      1 & \cdots & 1 & 1 & 1 &
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      \omega_0 \\
      \omega_0 \\
      \vdots \\
      \omega_{n-1} \\
      \omega_n
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
      0 \\
      0 \\
      \vdots \\
      0 \\
      1
   \end{bmatrix} \label{eqn:fci_eq_sys}
\end{equation}
where we let $\mathcal{P}_i = \tr(\mP_i)$.

Our proposed filter aims to solve FCI fusion, namly \eqref{eqn:ci_cov}, \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate} and \eqref{eqn:fci_eq_sys}, homomorphically, such that using only encryptions from each sensor $i$ we are able to produce valid encryptions of fused estimates without the need for decryption.

\section{Homomorphic and Order Revealing Encryption} \label{sec:encryption}
To achieve a secure solution to the FCI fusion problem, we have made use of two types of function-providing encryption schemes. Public-key additive Partially Homomorphic Encryption schemes \cite{paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999,goldwasserProbabilisticEncryption1984a} provide a single homomorphic addition operation on cyphertexts such that
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}(a) \oplus \mathcal{E}(b) = \mathcal{E}(a+b) \label{eqn:phe_eq}
\end{equation}
holds. While symettric-key Order Revealing Encryption schemes \cite{chenettePracticalOrderRevealingEncryption2016,lewiOrderRevealingEncryptionNew2016} provide a secure comparison function, allowing the comparison of encrypted values via
\begin{equation}
   f(\mathcal{E}_{ORE}(a), \mathcal{E}_{ORE}(b)) = cmp(a, b)\,. \label{eqn:ore_eq}
\end{equation}

The formal security of encryption schemes consists of a security goal and a formal threat model \cite{katzIntroductionModernCryptography2007}. Indistinguishability of ciphertexts under the adaptive chosen ciphertext attack model (IND-CCA2) is the commonly considered strongest security guarantee \cite{bellareRelationsNotionsSecurity1998}, however, cannot be satisfied by any homomorphic encryption scheme due to their apparent ability to create valid cyphertexts via homomorphic operations. Instead, PHE schemes aim to protect against the weaker assumption of the chosen plaintext attack model (IND-CPA) \cite{chaseSECURITYHOMOMORPHICENCRYPTION}. Similarly, ORE schemes aim to protect against the ordered chosen-plaintext attack (IND-OCPA) or weaker simulation-based security defined in \cite{chenettePracticalOrderRevealingEncryption2016} which allows for some leakage.

\subsection{Additive Partially Homomorphic Encryption} \label{subsec:paillier}
The additive PHE scheme we have used is the Paillier encryption scheme \cite{paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999} due to its implementation simplicity, and computational speed. The Paillier scheme provides two homomorphic operations on encrypted data, namely 
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}_{pk}(a)\mathcal{E}_{pk}(b) \pmod{N^{2}} = \mathcal{E}_{pk}(a + b \pmod{N}) \label{eqn:paillier_add}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}_{pk}(a)^c \pmod{N^{2}} = \mathcal{E}_{pk}(ca \pmod{N}),\ c \in \mathbb{Z}^*_N\,, \label{eqn:paillier_mult}
\end{equation}
where the modulus $N$ is computed as the product of 2 large primes chosen randomly during key generation. The public and secret keys are shown as $pk$ and $sk$ respectively, and plaintext messages $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_N$. The Paillier encryption scheme successfully protects against the IND-CPA security goal and attacker model.

\subsection{Left-Right Order Revealing Encryption} \label{subsec:lewi}
The ORE scheme we have used is Lewi's symmetric-key Left-Right encryption scheme \cite{lewiOrderRevealingEncryptionNew2016} which has the added property of only allowing certain comparisons between cyphertexts. This property can be used to decide which values may not be compared as will be shown in section \ref{sec:secfci} and is described as follows. Two encryption functions allow integers to be encrypted as either a ``Left'' ($L$) or ``Right'' ($R$) encryption by
\begin{equation}
   \begin{gathered} \label{eqn:lewi_l_r}
      enc^L_{ORE}(k, x) = \mathcal{E}^L_{ORE,k}(x) \\
      enc^R_{ORE}(k, y) = \mathcal{E}^R_{ORE,k}(y)\,,
   \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
and only comparisons between an $L$ and an $R$ encryption are possible, by
\begin{equation}
   cmp_{ORE}(\mathcal{E}^L_{ORE}(x),\ \mathcal{E}^R_{ORE}(y)) = cmp(x, y)\,. \label{eqn:lewi_cmp}
\end{equation}
Note that no decryption function is provided, as encryptions are only required to provide a means of secure comparison. The Lewi ORE encryption scheme does not satisfy IND-OCPA security due to its apparent difficulty, and instead satisfies the simulation-based notion of ORE security \cite{lewiOrderRevealingEncryptionNew2016,chenettePracticalOrderRevealingEncryption2016}.

\subsection{Real Number Encoding for Homomorphic Encryption}
Both encryption schemes in sections \ref{subsec:paillier} and \ref{subsec:lewi} are defined over positive integers, while the Paillier scheme further gives an upper bound $N$ to the size of an encryptable integer. Due to the prevalence of real numbers in estimation theory, typically stored as floating-point numbers in modern-day hardware, an integer encoding of real number values is required for their encryption. This requires the handling of both fractional, and negative numbers. 

Negative numbers can be handled using the common two's complement method of representing negative integers \cite{liljaDesigningDigitalComputer}. This is done by splitting the total range of allowable integers $[0, N)$ in half, and letting the upper half $[\frac{N}{2}, N)$ represent negative integers. From this, we can see that the value of the largest encryptable integer is now given by $N/2-1$ and that the addition of two's complement numbers is automatically preserved due to modulo arithmetic.
   
The handling of fractional numbers proves to be a more complicated matter, due to the homomorphic multiplication property of the Paillier encryption scheme \eqref{eqn:paillier_mult}. Fractional numbers are represented as integers using the quantising Q number format \cite{oberstarFixedPointRepresentationFractional}. The encoding of a real number $a$, with maximum integer bits $i$ and fractional bits $f$ is represented by an $i+f$ bit long integer $e$, such that the maximum encoding is given by $2^{(i+f)}-1$. Encoding is performed by
\begin{equation}
   e = \floor{2^f a}\,. \label{eqn:qmn}
\end{equation}
While encoded Q numbers are consistent under addition, multiplication requires a factor of $1/2^f$ to be removed. As homomorphic division is not supported by the Paillier encryption scheme, the number of multiplications performed on encrypted values must be bounded and handled when decoding. As will be shown in section \ref{sec:secfci}, our fusion method will always require that a single multiplication factor be removed and leads to the decoding of an integer $e$ to a real number $a$ being given by
\begin{equation}
   a = \frac{e}{2^{2f}}\,. \label{eqn:qmn_mult_decode}
\end{equation}

While the largest encryptable integer is given by $N/2-1$, the largest encodable real number must account for the additional multiplication factor and must have $i$ and $f$ chosen such that
\begin{equation}
   (2^{(i+f)}-1)^2 \leq \frac{N}{2}-1 \label{eqn:qmn_max}
\end{equation}
holds.

\section{Two-sensor Secure Fast Covariance Intersection} \label{sec:secfci}
In this section, we will introduce the Secure FCI (SecFCI) fusion algorithm for the two-sensor case, before extending it to the $n$-sensor case in section \ref{sec:multi_secfci}. The network model we will consider is one where all sensors are capable of running local estimation filters, as well as the PHE and ORE encryption schemes described in section \ref{sec:encryption}. Each sensor $i$ computes its state estimate and estimate error, $\mean{\vec{x}_i}$ and $\mP_i$, and sends the relevant encrypted information to a single fusion centre which aims to compute the fused state estimate and estimate error homomorphically. A third, querying party, can request and use the current encrypted fused information from the fusion centre at any time. The querying party is the key holding party in this network and generates the PHE public key $pk$, secret key $sk$, and ORE symmetric key $k$. $pk$ is made available to all parties in the network, and $k$ made available to the sensors only, via any standard public-key scheme such as RSA \cite{rivestMethodObtainingDigital1978}. When encrypting with ORE key $k$, individual sensors are limited to using only $L$ or $R$ ORE encryption to reduce local information leakage. Thus, consecutive ORE encryptions from any sensor cannot be used to infer local information directly, and can only be compared to encryptions from sensors using the alternate ORE encryption.

From the CI equations \eqref{eqn:ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate} we can see that both fusion equations can be computed on PHE encryptions of sensor information matrices and vectors, given valid values for each $\omega_i$. In the two-sensor case, homomorphic fusion is computed by
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}) = \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_0)^{\omega_0}\mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_1)^{(1 -\omega_0)} \label{eqn:paillier_ci_cov}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}\mean{\vec{x}}) = \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_0\mean{\vec{x}}_0)^{\omega_0}\mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_1\mean{\vec{x}}_1)^{(1 - \omega_0)}\,, \label{eqn:paillier_ci_estimate}
\end{equation}
where we note that $\omega_1=1-\omega_0$ due to the CI requirements \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_sum} and \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_bound}. We also note that in \eqref{eqn:paillier_ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:paillier_ci_estimate}, each resulting value will have exactly one Q encoding multiplication factor to remove, and can be decoded exactly by using \eqref{eqn:qmn_mult_decode}.
   
In the two-sensor case, all that remains for computing CI homomorphically is the calculation of parameter $\omega_0$. For this, we approximate the solution to the FCI fusion algorithm. Since analytical solutions \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_sol} require division, they cannot be computed exactly with the given PHE encryptions of sensor information matrices and vectors. Instead, we discretise $\omega_0$ by step-size $s$, such that $s<1$ and $s|1$, and turn to ORE to approximate \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_eq}. Each sensor computes $\tr(\mP)\omega$ for each ordered discretisation $\omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]$, and encrypts it with its ORE key $k$. Each sensor $i$ uses $L$ ORE if $i$ is even, and $R$ ORE otherwise. The resulting encryptions are kept ordered and sent alongside the PHE encryptions of local information matrix and vector estimates. Sensor $0$'s list is defined by 
\begin{equation}
   [\mathcal{E}^L_{ORE}(\omega\tr(\mP_0)),\ \omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]] \label{eqn:sen0_ore_list}
\end{equation}
and similarly sensor $1$'s by
\begin{equation}
   [\mathcal{E}^R_{ORE}(\omega\tr(\mP_1)),\ \omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]]\,. \label{eqn:sen1_ore_list}
\end{equation}
Lists \eqref{eqn:sen0_ore_list} and \eqref{eqn:sen1_ore_list} are then used to estimate the FCI values of $\omega_0$ and $\omega_1$ before computing \eqref{eqn:paillier_ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:paillier_ci_estimate}.

From \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_eq} and \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_omega_sum} we know that $\omega_0$ must satisfy
\begin{equation}
   \omega_0 \tr(\mP_0) = (1-\omega_1)\tr(\mP_1)\,. \label{eqn:secfci_2sen_intersect}
\end{equation}
If we reverse \eqref{eqn:sen1_ore_list}, we obtain the equivalent list
\begin{equation}
   [\mathcal{E}^R_{ORE}((1-\omega)\tr(\mP_1)),\ \omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]] \label{eqn:sen2_ore_rev_list}
\end{equation}
which when decrypted and plotted over \eqref{eqn:sen1_ore_list} shows that the intersecting point gives the solution to \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_eq}. However, \eqref{eqn:sen1_ore_list} and \eqref{eqn:sen2_ore_rev_list} consist of $L$ and $R$ ORE encryptions respectively, and the intersection must be approximated by locating the consecutive $\omega$ discretisations where the sign of comparisons changes. This can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:2_sensor_sol}, and can be performed in $O(log(1/s))$ by a binary search.
\begin{figure}[tb]

   \caption{Approximation of $\omega_0$ with discretisation step-size $s=0.1$. Only comparisons between line points are used.}
   \label{fig:2_sensor_sol}
\end{figure}
Consecutive $\omega_l$ and $\omega_u$ for which list comparisons differ can be used to estimate the true intersection, and $\omega_0$, by
\begin{equation}
   \omega_0'=\frac{1}{2}(\omega_l + \omega_u)\,. \label{eqn:secfci_2sen_omega}
\end{equation}
In the case a comparison returns equality, the exact value of $\omega$ can be taken to be $\omega_0$.

\section{Multi-sensor Secure Fast Covariance Intersection} \label{sec:multi_secfci}
When computing the SecFCI fusion for $n$ sensors, we solve \eqref{eqn:ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate} homomorphically by computing
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}) = \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_0)^{\omega_0}\cdots\mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_n)^{\omega_n} \label{eqn:n_sen_paillier_ci_cov}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}\mean{\vec{x}}) = \mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_0\mean{\vec{x}}_0)^{\omega_0}\cdots\mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_n\mean{\vec{x}}_n)^{\omega_n}\,. \label{eqn:n_sen_paillier_ci_estimate}
\end{equation}
As with the two-sensor case, encoded results from \eqref{eqn:n_sen_paillier_ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:n_sen_paillier_ci_estimate} contain exactly one multiplication factor to remove and can be decoded exactly with \eqref{eqn:qmn_mult_decode}. Again we are just left with computing the weights $\omega_0,\dots,\omega_n$.

Our approach to the $n$-sensor case, is to solve each $n-1$ conditions in \eqref{eqn:fci_eq} using the two-sensor method, and combining partial solutions to compute the final result. When we consider each $\omega_i$ a dimensional axis, partial solutions can be considered geometrically, as hyperplanes of $n-2$ dimension, over the $n-1$ dimensional solution space given by \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_sum} and \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_bound}. This can be visualised in the three-sensor case, which requires solving partial solutions
\begin{equation}
   \omega_0 \tr(\mP_0) - \omega_1 \tr(\mP_1) = 0 \label{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   \omega_1 \tr(\mP_1) - \omega_2 \tr(\mP_2) = 0\,. \label{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_2}
\end{equation}
Fig. \ref{fig:3_sensor_partial_sol} shows partial solution \eqref{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_1} plotted over the possible solution space. Partial solution points are given by solving the two-sensor case for $\omega_j$ and $\omega_k$ and letting all $\omega_i=0,\ i\neq j,k$, plus an additional point for each $\omega_i=1,\ i\neq j,k$ with $\omega_j=\omega_k=0$. Both partial solutions to \eqref{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_1} and \eqref{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_2} can be seen plotted over the solution space in Fig. \ref{fig:3_sensor_partial_sols}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
   \begin{center}
      \input{images/partial_sol1.pgf}
   \end{center}
   \caption{Partial solution to \eqref{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_1} over plane of $\omega_0$, $\omega_1$, and $\omega_2$ solution space.}
   \label{fig:3_sensor_partial_sol}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[tb]
   \begin{center}
      \input{images/partial_sols.pgf}
   \end{center}
   \caption{Partial solutions to \eqref{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_1} and \eqref{eqn:3_sensor_partial_sol_2} over plane of $\omega_0$, $\omega_1$, and $\omega_2$ solution space.}
   \label{fig:3_sensor_partial_sols}
\end{figure}
Finding the final solution from all partial solutions is computed by finding their intersection. This can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:3_sensor_partial_sols} as the intersection of the $\omega_0,\omega_1$ and $\omega_1,\omega_2$ partial solution lines. Due to their inherent orthogonality, $n-1$ partial solution hyperplanes are guaranteed to intersect at exactly one point when at most $1$ sensor has $\tr(\mP_i)=0$.

To simplify computing the partial solution intersection, we define equivalent hyperplanes of dimension $n-1$, perpendicular to the solution space, and solve the resulting $n$ simultaneous linear equations.

In the three-sensor case, each partial solution line can be defined by a plane perpendicular to the solution space plane in the form
\begin{equation}
   a_0\omega_0 + a_1\omega_1 +a_2\omega_2 + a_3 = 0\,, \label{eqn:3sen_plane_eq}
\end{equation}
as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:3sen_planes}. The resulting linear system and solution is then given by
\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      a_{0,0} & a_{1,0} & a_{2,0} \\
      a_{0,1} & a_{1,1} & a_{2,1} \\
      1 & 1 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      \omega_0 \\
      \omega_1 \\
      \omega_2
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
      a_{3,0} \\
      a_{3,1} \\
      1
   \end{bmatrix}\,, \label{eqn:3sen_plane_sol_eq}
\end{equation}
where $a_{i,j}$ denotes parameter $i$ of partial solution $j$.
\begin{figure}[tb]
   \begin{center}
      \input{images/partial_sol_planes.pgf}
   \end{center}
   \caption{Partial solutions from Fig. \ref{fig:3_sensor_partial_sols} as planes perpendicular to the solution space plane. Intersection point gives SecFCI solutions for each $\omega_i$.}
   \label{fig:3sen_planes}
\end{figure}

In the case with $n$ sensors, the hyperplanes equations are given by
\begin{equation}
   a_0\omega_0 + a_1\omega_1 + \cdots + a_n\omega_n + a_{n+1} = 0\,, \label{eqn:hyperplane_eq}
\end{equation}
and simultaneous equations and solution by
\begin{equation}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      a_{0,0} & a_{1,0} & \cdots & a_{n,0} \\
      a_{0,1} & a_{1,1} & \cdots & a_{n,1} \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      a_{0,n-1} & a_{1,n-1} & \cdots & a_{n,n-1} \\
      1 & 1 & \cdots & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      \omega_0 \\
      \omega_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      \omega_{n-1} \\
      \omega_n
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
      a_{n+1,0} \\
      a_{n+1,1} \\
      \vdots \\
      a_{n+1,n-1} \\
      1
   \end{bmatrix}. \label{eqn:hyperplane_sol_eq}
\end{equation}

As all ORE comparisons between sensor values are done between sequential sensors, $L$ and $R$ ORE encryptions can be used to the same effect as for the two-sensor case. The ORE ordered list sent from each sensor is given by
\begin{equation}
   \begin{gathered} \label{eqn:sensor_lists}
      [\mathcal{E}^L_{ORE}(\omega\tr(\mP^{-1}_i)),\ \omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]],\ i\text{ even} \\
      [\mathcal{E}^R_{ORE}(\omega\tr(\mP^{-1}_i)),\ \omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]],\ i\text{ odd}\,.
   \end{gathered}

\section{Simulation Results} \label{sec:results}
We have implemented a simulation to demonstrate and compare the SecFCI algorithm. Three sensors independently measured a two-dimensional constant-speed linear process, and simultaneously run a linear Kalman filter on their measurements. Estimates were then sent both unencrypted and encrypted to a fusion centre which computed the FCI and SecFCI fusions on the received data respectively. Unencrypted estimates consisted of the state estimate and estimate error $\mean{\vec{x}}_i$ and $\mP_i$, while encrypted estimates were comprised of PHE encryptions of the information matrix and vector $\mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_i\mean{\vec{x}}_i)$ and $\mathcal{E}(\mP^{-1}_i)$, and the ORE list given by \eqref{eqn:sensor_lists}. The trajectory and fused estimates are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fci_secfci_traj}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
   \begin{center}
      \input{images/fci_secfci_cmp.pgf}
   \end{center}
   \caption{Tracking simulation comparing FCI and SecFCI methods.}
   \label{fig:fci_secfci_traj}
\end{figure}

The traces of the fused estimate errors from both FCI and SecFCI fusion are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fci_secfci_trace}. As can be seen, the trace difference is very small, and due to both methods approximating CI's minimisation function \eqref{eqn:ci_trace_min}, neither is necessarily a bound on the other.

   \caption{Traces of fused estimate errors for FCI and SecFCI.}
   \label{fig:fci_secfci_trace}
\end{figure}
Values of each $\omega_i$ over time have been plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:fci_secfci_omegas}. Due to discretisation, and as can be expected, SecFCI values of $\omega_i$ stay constant, but may jump with sufficient change in the true FCI $\omega_i$ values they estimate.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
FCI is a commonly used, efficiently computable, approximation to the CI optimisation problem which requires the sharing of local sensor estimates to compute their fusion. We have proposed a secure approximation to FCI, SecFCI, to compute sensor estimate fusion homomorphically. The novel encrypted signal processing approach may find uses in various security-critical applications, or over untrusted networks. It is clear that particular computational requirements are necessary for the computation of SecFCI, and that it may only be practical in specific scenarios. Namely, the ability for sensors to compute local estimation and encryption is required. Possible future work includes a run-time comparison between SecFCI and potential FHE implementations, giving a computational bound for its practicality. Also, we hope to further quantize ORE leakage concerning SecFCI fusion and produce formal security proofs and assumptions for the novel algorithm.

% \section{INTRODUCTION}

% This template provides authors with most of the formatting specifications needed for preparing electronic versions of their papers. All standard paper components have been specified for three reasons: (1) ease of use when formatting individual papers, (2) automatic compliance to electronic requirements that facilitate the concurrent or later production of electronic products, and (3) conformity of style throughout a conference proceedings. Margins, column widths, line spacing, and type styles are built-in; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document and are identified in italic type, within parentheses, following the example. Some components, such as multi-leveled equations, graphics, and tables are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow.

% \section{PROCEDURE FOR PAPER SUBMISSION}

% \subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

% First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. 
% It may be used for A4 paper size if the paper size setting is suitably modified.

% \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

% The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

% \section{MATH}

% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

% Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}

% \begin{itemize}

% \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
% \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
% \item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

% \end{itemize}


% \subsection{Equations}

% The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

% $$
% \alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
% $$

% Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
% \begin{itemize}


% \item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
% \item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
% \item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
% \item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
% \item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
% \item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

% \section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

% Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

% It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

% \subsection{Headings, etc}

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}

% Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

% \begin{table}[h]
% \caption{An Example of a Table}
% \label{table_example}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
% \hline
% One & Two\\
% \hline
% Three & Four\\
% \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \end{table}


%    \begin{figure}[thpb]
%       \centering
%       \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
% }}
%       %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
%       \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
%        magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
%       \label{figurelabel}
%    \end{figure}
   

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

% \section{CONCLUSIONS}

% A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

% \addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
%                                   % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
%                                   % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
%                                   % This command does not take effect until the next page
%                                   % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
%                                   % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

% Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

% \section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

% The preferred spelling of the word ÒacknowledgmentÓ in America is without an ÒeÓ after the ÒgÓ. Avoid the stilted expression, ÒOne of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .Ó  Instead, try ÒR. B. G. thanksÓ. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
