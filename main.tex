\begin{abstract}

Fast covariance intersection is a widespread technique for state estimate fusion in sensor networks when cross-correlations are not known and fast computations are desired. The common requirement of sending estimates from one party to another during fusion means they do not remain private to their producing party. Current secure fusion algorithms have a reliance on encryption schemes that do not provide sufficient flexibility and as a result require, often undesired, excess communication between estimate producers. We propose a novel method of homomorphically computing the fast covariance intersection algorithm on estimates encrypted with a combination of encryption schemes. Using order revealing encryption we show how to approximate solutions to the fast covariance intersection coefficients can be computed and combined with partially homomorphic encryptions of estimates, to compute an encryption of the fused result. The described approach allows the secure fusion of any number of private estimates, making third-party cloud processing a viable option when working with sensitive state estimates, or when performing estimation over insecure networks.

\end{abstract}

\section{Covariance Intersection and Approximations}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Covariance intersection (CI) is a method for fusing state estimations for different sources when models and cross-correlations are not known
   \item The fused estimate and estimate covariance are commuted by \eqref{eqn:ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate}
   \item Note that the estimate and estimate covariance depicted in \eqref{eqn:ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate} are in the Information filter form of the popular Kalman Filter as this simplifies computation.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \mP^{-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\omega_i \mP_i^{-1} \label{eqn:ci_cov}\\
   \mP^{-1} \mean{\vec{x}} =\sum_{i=0}^{n}\omega_i \mP_i^{-1} \mean{\vec{x}}_i \label{eqn:ci_estimate}\\
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Where values $\omega_i$ satisfy \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_sum} and \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_bound} and are chosen in a way to minimise a property of the resulting fused estimate. 
   \item For example minimising the resulting trace would require solving \eqref{eqn:ci_trace_min}
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \omega_0 + \omega_1 + \cdots + \omega_n = 1 \label{eqn:ci_omega_sum}\\
   0 \leq \omega_i \leq 1 \label{eqn:ci_omega_bound}\\
   \argmin_{\omega_0,\dots,\omega_n} \{\tr(\mP)\} = \argmin_{\omega_0,\dots,\omega_n} \{\tr((\sum_{i=0}^{n}\omega_i \mP_i)^{-1})\} \label{eqn:ci_trace_min}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Minimising a given non linear cost function such as \eqref{eqn:ci_trace_min} can be very costly computationally and has led to the development of non-iterative approximation techniques \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002}, \cite{frankenImprovedFastCovariance2005}, \cite{congOrderInsensitiveSequential2016}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fast Covariance intersection}
\begin{itemize}
   \item The fast covariance intersection (FCI) algorithm described in \cite{niehsenInformationFusionBased2002} is a common method used for approximating the solution to \eqref{eqn:ci_trace_min} by defining a new constraint on $\omega_i$ and solving that instead.
   \item In the 2 sensor case, \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_sum} now becomes \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_omega_sum}, and the additional requirement of \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_eq} is also defined. Solutions are defined analytically and shown in \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_sol}
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \omega_0 + \omega_1 = 1 \label{eqn:fci_2sen_omega_sum}\\
   \omega_0 \tr(\mP_0) - \omega_1 \tr(\mP_1) = 0 \label{eqn:fci_2sen_eq}\\
   \omega_0 = \frac{\tr(\mP_1)}{\tr(\mP_0)+\tr(\mP_1)},\ \omega_1 = \frac{\tr(\mP_0)}{\tr(\mP_0)+\tr(\mP_1)} \label{eqn:fci_2sen_sol}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item When extending to any number of sensors, restriction \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_eq} is generalised to \eqref{eqn:fci_eq_big}
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \omega_i \tr(\mP_i) - \omega_j \tr(\mP_j) = 0,\ (i,j=1,2,\dots,n) \label{eqn:fci_eq_big}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Equation \eqref{eqn:fci_eq_big} is highly redundant and its largest linearly independent subset can be represented with \eqref{eqn:fci_eq}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \omega_i \tr(\mP_i) - \omega_{i+1} \tr(\mP_{i+1}) = 0,\ (i=1,2,\dots,n) \label{eqn:fci_eq}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item The solution to \eqref{eqn:fci_eq} and \eqref{eqn:ci_omega_sum} can be represented as the simultaneous equations problem shown in \eqref{eqn:fci_eq_sys} where $\mathcal{P}_i = \tr(\mP_i)$
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      \mathcal{P}_0 & -\mathcal{P}_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
      0 & \mathcal{P}_1 & -\mathcal{P}_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \\
      0 & \cdots & 0 & \mathcal{P}_{n-1} & -\mathcal{P}_n \\
      1 & \cdots & 1 & 1 & 1 &
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
      \omega_0 \\
      \omega_0 \\
      \vdots \\
      \omega_{n-1} \\
      \omega_n
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
      0 \\
      0 \\
      \vdots \\
      0 \\
      1
   \end{bmatrix} \label{eqn:fci_eq_sys}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Our goal for secure fusion is to solve \eqref{eqn:ci_cov}, \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate} and \eqref{eqn:fci_eq_sys} using only encryptions from each sensor $i$.

\section{Homomorphic and Order Revealing Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
   \item To achieve a secure solution to the FCI fusion problem, we have focused on two types of function providing encryption schemes. 
   \item Additive partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) schemes such ones defined in \cite{paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999} and \cite{goldwasserProbabilisticEncryption1984a} provide a homomorphic addition operation as shown in \eqref{eqn:phe_eq}.
   \item Order revealing encryption (ORE) schemes such as those in \cite{chenettePracticalOrderRevealingEncryption2016} and \cite{lewiOrderRevealingEncryptionNew2016} provide a function which allows the comparison of encrypted values as shown in \eqref{eqn:ore_eq}
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \mathcal{E}(a) \oplus \mathcal{E}(b) = \mathcal{E}(a+b) \label{eqn:phe_eq}\\
   f(\mathcal{E}(a), \mathcal{E}(b)) = cmp(a, b) \label{eqn:ore_eq}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Additive Partially Homomorphic Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
   \item We have used the Paillier encryption scheme described in \cite{paillierPublicKeyCryptosystemsBased1999} for the computation of the FCI due to its speed and implementation simplicity.
   \item The Paillier encryption scheme is a public key scheme, where encryptions are made with a public key but only the secret key holder can decrypt them.
   \item It provides two homomorphic operations on encrypted data, shown in \eqref{eqn:paillier_add} and \eqref{eqn:paillier_mult}. The modulus $N$ is computed as a product of 2 large primes which are part of the secret key.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \mathcal{E}(a)\mathcal{E}(b) \pmod{N} = \mathcal{E}(a + b \pmod{N}) \label{eqn:paillier_add}\\
   \mathcal{E}(a)^c \pmod{N} = \mathcal{E}(ca \pmod{N}),\ c \in \mathbb{Z}_N \label{eqn:paillier_mult}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Encrypted numbers must be less than $N$, and negative numbers can be handled by storing integers in ``two's complement'' binary form, that is taking $[0, \frac{N}{2})$ as all possible positive numbers, and $[\frac{N}{2}, N)$ as the decreasing negative integers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real Number Encoding for Homomorphic Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
   \item The Paillier encryption scheme can only encrypt, add, and multiply with integers. Due to the prevalence of real number values in sensor outputs and estimation processes, some form of encoding is required for these numbers to be encrypted.
   \item Real numbers, typically stored as floating-point numbers in sensor hardware, are converted to integers using the ``Q'' number format. A real number $a$ can be encoded to an integer $e$ using \eqref{eqn:qmn}, where the largest encodable real number has an integer part of $i$ bits. Integer bits $i$ and fractional bits $f$ are chosen such that the largest encoded value can still be encrypted.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   e = 
   \begin{cases}
      \floor{2^f a} & a<2^i\\
      \floor{2^f (2^i - a)} & a\geq 2^i\\
   \end{cases}\label{eqn:qmn}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item While the encoded real numbers are consistent under addition, multiplication by constants requires that a factor of $\frac{1}{2^f}$ be removed. 
   \item Since division is not supported under the encryption scheme, the number of multiplications performed on an encrypted value must be bounded and handled when decoding. This also decreases the size of the largest encodable real number that can be decoded correctly.
   \item In our case, only a single multiplication is required, and decoding of an integer $e$ to a real number $f$ is performed by \eqref{eqn:qmn_mult_decode}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   a = 
   \begin{cases}
      \frac{e}{2^f} & e<2^{(i+f)}\\
      \frac{e}{2^{2f}} & e\geq 2^{(i+f)}\\
   \end{cases}\label{eqn:qmn_mult_decode}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Left-Right Order Revealing Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
   \item For the ORE scheme we have considered in particular the Left-Right encryption scheme described in \cite{lewiOrderRevealingEncryptionNew2016} which will help in preventing information leakage as described in section \ref{sec:secfci}.
   \item The key difference between this scheme and others is how numbers are compared. Left-Right encryption allows any number to be encrypted as either a ``Left'' or ``Right'' encryption, but only a ``Left'' encryption can be compared with a ``Right'' encryption. The provided function of the encryption scheme are shown in \eqref{eqn:lewi_eqs}
   \item The ORE scheme described requires a single symmetric key for the encryption of either ``Left'' or ``Right'' encryptions, which can be compared without any key.
\end{itemize}
% Consider not needing at least the comparison equations below as it probably won't be used again and can be explained in words
\begin{gather} \label{eqn:lewi_eqs}
   encrypt^L_{ORE}(sk, x) = \mathcal{E}^L_{ORE}(x) \\
   encrypt^R_{ORE}(sk, y) = \mathcal{E}^R_{ORE}(y) \\
   compare_{ORE}(\mathcal{E}^L_{ORE}(x),\ \mathcal{E}^R_{ORE}(y)) = cmp(x, y)
\end{gather}

\section{Secure Fast Covariance Intersection with 2 Sensors} \label{sec:secfci}
\begin{itemize}
   \item First we will consider the 2 sensor case of secure FCI (SecFCI), before extending it to any number of sensors in section \ref{sec:multi_secfci}. We consider sensor 0 which produces the estimate $\mean{\vec{x}_0}$ and covariance $\mP_0$, and similarly sensor 1 producing $\mean{\vec{x}}_1$ and $\mP_1$.
   \item From \eqref{eqn:ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:ci_estimate} we can see that CI is particularly suited to PHE schemes. Sensor encrypted estimates and covariances can be combined additively using \eqref{eqn:paillier_add} and \eqref{eqn:paillier_mult}. The equations using the Paillier encrtyption systems to compute CI are given in \eqref{eqn:paillier_ci_cov} and \eqref{eqn:paillier_ci_estimate}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \mathcal{E}(\mP) = \mathcal{E}(\mP_0)^{\omega_0}\mathcal{E}(\mP_1)^{(1 -\omega_0)} \label{eqn:paillier_ci_cov}\\
   \mathcal{E}(\mP\mean{\vec{x}}) = \mathcal{E}(\mP_0\mean{\vec{x}}_0)^{\omega_0}\mathcal{E}(\mP_1\mean{\vec{x}}_1)^{(1 - \omega_0)} \label{eqn:paillier_ci_estimate}\\
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item What remains is the computation of the parameter $\omega$. The FCI solutions for the 2 sensor case given by \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_sol}, cannot be computed with PHE encryptions due to the required division.
   \item Instead we discretise $\omega$ to steps of some size $s<1$ such that $s$ divides 1, and use the ORE scheme to compute \eqref{eqn:fci_2sen_eq}. Each sensor discretises $\omega$ and multiplies each discretisation with $\tr(\mP^{-1})$ of its current coveriance $\mP$. Each result is then encrypted with the Left-Right ORE scheme.
   \item Sensor 0 encrypts using the Left scheme as shown in \eqref{eqn:sen0_ore_list} and similarly for sensor 1 using Right encryption in \eqref{eqn:sen1_ore_list}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   [\mathcal{E}^L_{ORE}(\omega\tr(\mP^{-1}_0)),\ \omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]] \label{eqn:sen0_ore_list} \\
   [\mathcal{E}^R_{ORE}(\omega\tr(\mP^{-1}_1)),\ \omega \in [0,0+s,\dots,1-s,1]] \label{eqn:sen1_ore_list}
\end{gather}
\begin{itemize}
   \item The two ordered encrypted lists \eqref{eqn:sen0_ore_list} and \eqref{eqn:sen1_ore_list} are recieved at the fusion center, and used to estimate $\omega$.
   \item To compute the FCI value for $\omega$ we want the intersection between the two lines described by $\tr(\mP_0)\omega$ and $\tr(\mP_1)(1-\omega)$. Note that in the 2 sensor case, the discretised list of $\tr(\mP_i)(1-\omega)$ can be obtained by simply reversing the list for $\tr(\mP_i)\omega$.
   \item Fig. \ref{fig:2_sensor_sol} shows the list from sensor 0 and the reversed list of sensor 1 plotted over $\omega$ with a step size $s=0.1$. Since values from one list can be compared with those from the other using the ORE operations described in \eqref{eqn:lewi_eqs}, the exact intersection can be approximated in $O(log(\frac{1}{s}))$ steps by performing a binary search.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htb]
   \begin{center}
      \input{images/2_sensors.pgf}
   \end{center}
   \caption{Approximation of $\omega_0$ with discretisation step size $s=0.1$. Only comparisons of the ordered values sent from either estimator are used.}
   \label{fig:2_sensor_sol}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Once the two consecutive differing comparisons from vertically aligned points in \ref{fig:2_sensor_sol} are found, the FCI $\omega$ can be approximated by taking the middle value between the two bounds. This is computed simply with \eqref{eqn:secfci_2sen_omega}.
   \item In the case where the comparison function from the ORE scheme returns an exact equality, the exact value of $\omega$ is known and can be taken as the approximation.
\end{itemize}
\begin{gather}
   \omega_0'=\frac{1}{2}(a + b),\ \omega_1' = (1-\omega_0) \label{eqn:secfci_2sen_omega}
\end{gather}

\section{Conclusion}



\vspace{2cm}
\section{INTRODUCTION}

Your goal is to simulate, as closely as possible, the usual appearance of typeset
 papers. This document provides an example of the desired layout and contains
 information regarding desktop publishing format, type sizes, and type faces.

\subsection{Full-Size Camera-Ready (CR) Copy}

If you have desktop publishing facilities, (the use of a computer to aid
 in the assembly of words and illustrations on pages) prepare your CR paper
  in full-size format, on paper 21.6 x 27.9 cm (8.5 x 11 in or 51 x 66 picas).
  It must be output on a printer (e.g., laser printer) having 300 dots/in, or
  better, resolution. Lesser quality printers, such as dot matrix printers,
   are not acceptable, as the manuscript will not reproduce the desired quality.

\subsubsection{Typefaces and Sizes:} There are many different typefaces and a large
variety of fonts (a complete set of characters in the same typeface, style,
 and size). Please use a proportional serif typeface such as Times Roman,
 or Dutch. If these are not available to you, use the closest typeface you
  can. The minimum typesize for the body of the text is 10 point. The minimum
  size for applications like table captions, footnotes, and text subscripts
  is 8 point. As an aid in gauging type size, 1 point is about 0.35 mm (1/72in).
   Examples are as follows:

\subsubsection{Format:} In formatting your original 8.5" x 11" page, set top and
bottom margins to 25 mm (1 in or 6 picas), and left and right margins
to about 18 mm (0.7 in or 4 picas). The column width is 88 mm (3.5 in or 21 picas).
 The space between the two columns is 5 mm(0.2 in or 1 pica). Paragraph
 indentation is about 3.5 mm (0.14 in or 1 pica). Left- and right-justify your
 columns. Cut A4 papers to 28 cm. Use either one or two spaces between sections,
 and between text and tables or figures, to adjust the column length.
  On the last page of your paper, try to adjust the lengths of the
  two-columns so that they are the same. Use automatic hyphenation and
   check spelling. Either digitize or paste your figures.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}

\end{center}
\end{table}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{UNITS}

Metric units are preferred for use in IEEE publications in light of their
international readership and the inherent convenience of these units in many fields.
In particular, the use of the International System of Units (SI Units) is advocated.
 This system includes a subsystem the MKSA units, which are based on the
 meter, kilogram, second, and ampere. British units may be used as secondary units
 (in parenthesis). An exception is when British units are used as identifiers in trade,
 such as, 3.5 inch disk drive.


\addtolength{\textheight}{-3cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section{ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS}

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Position figures and tables at the tops and bottoms of columns.
Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables
may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures;
 table captions should be above the tables. Avoid placing figures and tables
  before their first mention in the text. Use the abbreviation ``Fig. 1'',
  even at the beginning of a sentence.
Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion.
Try to use words rather then symbols. As an example write the quantity ``Inductance",
 or ``Inductance L'', not just.
 Put units in parentheses. Do not label axes only with units.
 In the example, write ``Inductance (mH)'', or ``Inductance L (mH)'', not just ``mH''.
 Do not label axes with the ratio of quantities and units.
 For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not ``Temperature/K''.

\subsection{Numbering}

% Number reference citations consecutively in square brackets \cite{c1}.
%  The sentence punctuation follows the brackets \cite{c2}.
%  Refer simply to the reference number, as in \cite{c3}.
%  Do not use ``ref. \cite{c3}'' or ``reference \cite{c3}''.
Number footnotes separately in superscripts\footnote{This is a footnote}
Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited.
Do not put footnotes in the reference list.
Use letters for table footnotes (see Table I).

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}

Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text,
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as
IEEE, SI, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use
abbreviations in the title unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Equations}

Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses flush
 with the right margin, as in (1). To make your equations more compact
 you may use the solidus (/), the exp. function, or appropriate exponents.
  Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols.
   Use a long dash rather then hyphen for a minus sign. Use parentheses to avoid
    ambiguities in the denominator.
Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence:
$$\Gamma_2 a^2 + \Gamma_3 a^3 + \Gamma_4 a^4 + ... = \lambda \Lambda(x),$$
where $\lambda$ is an auxiliary parameter.

Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the
equation appears or immediately following.
Use ``(1),'' not ``Eq. (1)'' or ``Equation (1),''
except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation (1) is ...''.
