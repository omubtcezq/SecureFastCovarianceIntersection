  abstract   = {In recent years, signal processing applications that deal with user-related data have aroused privacy concerns. For instance, face recognition and personalized recommendations rely on privacy-sensitive information that can be abused if the signal processing is executed on remote servers or in the cloud. In this tutorial article, we introduce the fusion of signal processing and cryptography as an emerging paradigm to protect the privacy of users. While service providers cannot access directly the content of the encrypted signals, the data can still be processed in encrypted form to perform the required signal processing task. The solutions for processing encrypted data are designed using cryptographic primitives like homomorphic cryptosystems and secure multiparty computation (MPC).},

Primary focus on this problem is a situation where there are two parties; a client with data or a signal that needs to be processed and a server with computational resources. Revealing the signal unencrypted causes a violation of privacy for the client. One solution to this problem is to process the data or signal while encrypted. Problems of this type have been attracting attention recently; particularly with the growing capabilities of cloud computing. We contribute to solving this type of problem by processing the signals in an encrypted form, using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Three additional contributions of this manuscript includes (1) extending FHE to real numbers, (2) bounding the error related to the FHE process against the unencrypted variation of the process, and (3) increasing the practicality of FHE as a tool by using graphical processing units (GPU). We demonstrate our contributions by applying these ideas to two classical problems: natural logarithm calculation and signal pr(brightness/contrast filter).},

  abstract  = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are ad-hoc networks composed of tiny devices with limited computation and energy capacities. For such devices, data transmission is a very energy-consuming operation. It thus becomes essential to the lifetime of a WSN to minimize the number of bits sent by each device. One well-known approach is to aggregate sensor data (e.g., by adding) along the path from sensors to the sink. Aggregation becomes especially challenging if end-to-end privacy between sensors and the sink is required. In this paper, we propose a simple and provably secure additively homomorphic stream cipher that allows efficient aggregation of encrypted data. The new cipher only uses modular additions (with very small moduli) and is therefore very well suited for CPU-constrained devices. We show that aggregation based on this cipher can be used to efficiently compute statistical values such as mean, variance and standard deviation of sensed data, while achieving significant bandwidth gain.},

However, most of existing schemes have not been widely used in practical applications due to their inefficiency. In this paper, we give an additive homomorphic encryption scheme which can be used for evaluating some statistical information, such as the mean and the variance. To compute the information without the multiplicative homomorphism, we devise a message encoding technique and design a new additive homomorphic encryption by applying our encoding technique to Paillier's scheme which supports the additive homomorphism. Note that our scheme is the first additive homomorphic encryption which supports the evaluation of both the mean and the variance of encrypted data. We also propose some modifications of our scheme to improve the practicality. One of remarkable advantages of our message encoding technique is that it can be applied to any additive homomorphic encryption for supporting the above mentioned statistical operations.},

Many applications, such as ASP, requiring a significant amount of processing at the data storage servers are hence precluded from using encryption to protect data privacy. To address this problem, this paper works on privacy homomorphism which allows encrypted data to be operated on. Two additive homomorphic schemes, namely iterated hill cipher (IHC) and modified rivest scheme (MRS), are given. They are secure to ciphertext-only attacks and have the nice property that the same data may have different representations in the encrypted domain.},

Homomorphic encryption can help address this problem by allowing the user to upload encrypted data to the cloud, on which the cloud can then operate without having the secret key. The cloud can return encrypted outputs of computations to the user without decrypting the data, thus providing data hosting and services without compromising privacy. This paper contribution is two-fold. First, it presents a survey into the subject of fully homomorphic encryption and highlights scenarios where homomorphic encryption could be an appropriate solution. Secondly, we focus on the modeling of number comparison in terms of homomorphic encryption. This approach is then used for applications such as the maximum value from a vector or the sorting problem.},

In this paper we present detailed analysis of coordinate and accelerated gradient descent algorithms which are capable of fitting least squares and penalised ridge regression models, using data encrypted under a fully homomorphic encryption scheme. Gradient descent is shown to dominate in terms of encrypted computational speed, and theoretical results are proven to give parameter bounds which ensure correctness of decryption. The characteristics of encrypted computation are empirically shown to favour a non-standard acceleration technique. This demonstrates the possibility of approximating conventional statistical regression methods using encrypted data without compromising privacy.},

  abstract  = {We compare the relative strengths of popular notions of security for public key encryption schemes. We consider the goals of privacy and non-malleability, each under chosen plaintext attack and two kinds of chosen ciphertext attack. For each of the resulting pairs of definitions we prove either an implication (every scheme meeting one notion must meet the other) or a separation (there is a scheme meeting one notion but not the other, assuming the first notion can be met at all). We similarly treat plaintext awareness, a notion of security in the random oracle model. An additional contribution of this paper is a new definition of non-malleability which we believe is simpler than the previous one.},
