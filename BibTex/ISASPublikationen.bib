  abstract = {With modern communication technology, sensors, estimators, and controllers can be pushed apart to distribute 
  intelligence over wide distances. Instead of congesting channels by periodic data transmissions, smart sensors can decide 
  on their own whether data are worth transmitting. This paper studies event-based transmissions from sensor to estimator. 
  The sensor-side event trigger conveys usable information even if no transmission is triggered. In the absence of data, 
  such implicit information can still be exploited by the remote Kalman filter. For this purpose, an easy-to-implement 
  triggering mechanism is proposed based on a Finite Impulse Response prediction that is compared against a stochastic 
  decision variable. By the aid of the stochastic event trigger, the implicit information retains a Gaussian representation 
  and can easily be processed by the Kalman filter. The parameters for the stochastic trigger are retrieved from the 
  Finite Impulse Response filter, which contributes to reducing the communication rate significantly, as shown in simulations.},

   abstract = {Decentralized data fusion is a challenging task even for 
linear estimation problems. Nonlinear estimation renders data fusion 
even more difficult as dependencies among the nonlinear estimates 
require complicated parameterizations. It is nearly impossible to 
reconstruct or keep track of dependencies. Therefore, conservative 
approaches have become a popular solution to nonlinear data fusion. As a 
generalization of Covariance Intersection, exponential mixture densities 
have been widely applied for nonlinear fusion. However, this approach 
inherits the conservativeness of Covariance Intersection. For this 
reason, the less conservative fusion rule Inverse Covariance 
Intersection is studied in this paper and also generalized to nonlinear 
data fusion. This generalization employs a conservative approximation of 
the common information shared by the estimates to be fused. This bound 
of the common information is subtracted from the fusion result. In doing 
so, less conservative fusion results can be attained as an empirical 
analysis demonstrates.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art optical sorting systems suffer from delays between the particle detection and separation stage, during which the material movement is not accounted for. Commonly line scan cameras, using simple assumptions to predict the future particle movement, are employed. In this study, a novel prediction approach is presented, where an area scan camera records the particle movement over multiple time steps and a tracking algorithm is used to reconstruct the corresponding paths to determine the time and position at which the material reaches the separation stage. In order to assess the benefit of such a model at different operating parameters, an automated optical belt sorter is numerically modelled and coupled with the tracking procedure. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to describe the particle–particle as well as particle–wall interactions, while the air nozzles required for deflecting undesired material fractions are described with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The accuracy of the employed numerical approach is ensured by comparing the separation results of a predefined sorting task with experimental investigations. The quality of the aforementioned prediction models is compared when utilizing different belt lengths, nozzle activation durations, particle types, sampling frequencies and detection windows. Results show that the numerical model of the optical belt sorter is able to accurately describe the sorting system and is suitable for detailed investigation of various operational parameters. The proposed tracking prediction model was found to be superior to the common line scan camera method in all investigated scenarios. Its advantage is especially profound when difficult sorting conditions, e.g. short conveyor belt lengths or uncooperative moving bulk solids, apply.},

the Hamilton product. Besides stochastic approaches, we also
introduce the Spherical Averaging Method (SAM), which is an
application of the Riemannian averaging technique. The two
approaches are then applied to a specific problem where the
wavefront orientation is estimated based on Time Differences of

In this paper, a novel technique is presented that provides the means to reconstruct the required correlation structure. For this purpose, each node computes a set of deterministic samples that provides all the information required to reassemble the cross-covariance matrix for each pair of estimates. As the number of samples is increasing over time, a method to reduce the size of the sample set is presented and studied. In doing so, communication expenses can be reduced significantly, but approximation errors are possibly introduced by neglecting past correlation terms. In order to keep approximation errors at a minimum, an appropriate set size can be determined and a trade-off between communication expenses and estimation quality can be found.},

  abstract  = {With the advent of cheap sensor technology, multisensor data fusion algorithms have been becoming a key enabler for efficient in-network processing of sensor data. The information filter, in particular, has proven useful due to its simple additive structure of the measurement update equations.
In order to exploit this structure for an efficient in-network processing, each node in the network is supposed to locally process and combine data from its neighboring nodes. The aspired in-network processing, at first glance, prohibits efficient privacy-preserving communication protocols, and encryption schemes that allow for algebraic manipulations are often computationally too expensive. Partially homomorphic encryption schemes constitute far more practical solutions but are restricted to a single algebraic operation on the corresponding ciphertexts. In this paper, an additive-homomorphic encryption scheme is used to derive a privacy-preserving implementation of the information filter where additive operations are sufficient to distribute the workload among the sensor nodes. However, the encryption scheme requires the floating-point data to be quantized, which impairs the estimation quality. The proposed filter and the implications of the necessary quantization are analyzed in a simulated multisensor tracking scenario.},

In particular, a distributed implementation of the optimal Kalman filter has recently been developed. A significant disadvantage of this algorithm is that the fusion center needs access to each node so as to compute a consistent state estimate, which requires full communication each time an estimate is requested. In this article, different extensions of the optimally distributed Kalman filter are proposed that employ data-driven transmission schemes in order to reduce communication expenses. As a first relaxation of the full-rate communication scheme, it can be shown that each node only has to transmit every second time step without endangering consistency of the fusion result. Also, two data-driven algorithms are introduced that even allow for lower transmission rates, and bounds are derived to guarantee consistent fusion results. Simulations demonstrate that the data-driven distributed filtering schemes can outperform a centralized Kalman filter that requires each measurement to be sent to the center node.},

We focus on the case where acknowledgment packets transmitted by the actuator upon reception of applicable control inputs are also subject to delays and losses, as opposed to the common notion of TCP-like communication where successful transmissions are acknowledged instantaneously and without losses. As a consequence, the state estimator in the considered setup has only partial and belated knowledge concerning the actually applied control inputs which results in additional uncertainty. We derive an estimator by extending an existing approach for the special case of UDP-like communication which maintains estimates of the applied control inputs that are incorporated into the estimation of the plant state. The presented estimator is compared to the original approach in terms of Monte Carlo simulations where its increased robustness towards imperfect knowledge of the underlying networks is indicated.},

often in the form of the Gaussian distribution. The assumption may be, however, difficult to be met in algorithms involving nonlinear
transformation of the random variable. This paper focuses on techniques capable to ensure validity of the Gaussian assumption of
the nonlinearly transformed Gaussian variable by approximating the to-be-transformed random variable distribution by a Gaussian
mixture distribution. The stress is laid on an analysis and selection of design parameters of the approximate Gaussian mixture
distribution to minimise the error imposed by the nonlinear transformation such as the location and number of the Gaussian mixture

non-Gaussianity. The proposed splitting directions are analysed and illustrated in numerical simulations.},

While state-of-the-art systems utilize scanning sensors such as line-scan cameras, advances in sensor technology have made application of area scanning sensors feasible. Provided a sufficiently high frame rate, objects can be observed at multiple points in time. By applying multiobject tracking, information about the objects contained in the material stream can be fused over time. Based on this information, our approach further allows predicting the position of each object for future points in time. While conventional systems typically apply a global, rather simple motion model, our approach includes an individual motion model for each object, which in turn allows estimating the point in time as well as the position when reaching the separation stage. In this contribution, we present results from our collaborative research project and summarize the present advances by discussing the potential of the application of area-scan sensors for sensor-based sorting. Among others, we introduce our simulation-driven approach and present results for physical separation efficiency for simulation-generated data, demonstrate the potential of using motion-based features for material classification and discuss real-time related challenges.},

  abstract = {Utilizing parallel algorithms is an established way of increasing performance in systems that are bound to real-time restrictions. Sensor-based sorting is a machine vision application for which firm real-time requirements need to be respected in order to reliably remove potentially harmful entities from a material feed. Recently, employing a predictive tracking approach using multitarget tracking in order to decrease the error in the physical separation in optical sorting has been proposed. For implementations that use hard associations between measurements and tracks, a linear assignment problem has to be solved for each frame recorded by a camera. The auction algorithm can be utilized for this purpose, which also has the advantage of being well suited for parallel architectures. In this paper, an improved implementation of this algorithm for a graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. The resulting algorithm is implemented in both an OpenCL and a CUDA based environment. By using an optimized data structure, the presented algorithm outperforms recently proposed implementations in terms of speed while retaining the quality of output of the algorithm. Furthermore, memory requirements are significantly decreased, which is important for embedded systems. Experimental results are provided for two different GPUs and six datasets. It is shown that the proposed approach is of particular interest for applications dealing with comparatively large problem sizes.},

Typically, involved sensors, illumination, implementation of data analysis and other components are designed and chosen according to the sorting task at hand. A common property of conventional systems is the utilization of scanning sensors. However, the usage of area-scan cameras has recently been proposed. When observing objects at multiple time points, the corresponding paths can be reconstructed by using multiobject tracking. This in turn allows to accurately estimate the point in time and position at which any object will reach the separation stage of the optical sorter and hence contributes to decreasing the error in physical separation. In this paper, it is proposed to further exploit motion information for the purpose of material characterization. By deriving suitable features from the motion information, we show that high classification performance is obtained for an exemplary classification task. The approach therefore contributes towards decreasing the detection error of sorting systems.},

    in such a way that the required calculations can be distributed

    only the locally acquired sensor data. The main downside of
    this implementation is that it requires each distributed sensor
    node to communicate with the fusion center in every time step
    so as to compute the optimal state estimate. In this paper,
    two distributed Kalman filtering algorithms are proposed to
    overcome these limitations. The first algorithm merely requires
    communication of each local sensor node with the fusion center
    in every other time step. The second algorithm even allows
    for a lower communicate rate. Both algorithms apply event-based 
    communication to compute consistent estimates and to
    reduce the estimation error for a fixed communication rate.
    Simulations demonstrate that both algorithms perform better in
    terms of the mean squared estimation error than the centralized
    Kalman filter.}

    transmissions are acknowledged instantaneously and without
    losses, we focus on the case where the acknowledgment packets
    provided by the actuator upon reception of applicable control
    inputs are also subject to delays and losses. Consequently,
    the estimator has only partial and belated knowledge on the

    uncertainty. We derive an estimator for the considered setup by

        solution is Covariance Intersection, which may provide too

Among those solutions there is a class of estimators exploiting the fact that an event was not triggered. Not receiving a new measurement is then interpreted as a sensor signal that has not violated the event criteria, which means that the signal is still within the triggering set defining the event. Such implied measurement information is exploited by the estimator, though it is only valid when no event occurred. The approach is thus sensitive to package loss and latency, as the estimator might be incorrect in assuming that no event took place. A solution to anticipate for package loss on the estimation error is studied in this article, and it is further turned into a first solution when the estimator is part of a feedback-control loop.},

Our goal is association-free tracking, so the associations will never be determined as this is costly and impractical in many scenarios. By employing a permutation-invariant and differentiable point set distance measure, we derive a modified association-free multi-target measurement equation. It maintains the target identities but is invariant to permutations in the unlabeled measurements. Based on this measurement equation, we derive an efficient sample-based association-free multi-target Kalman filter. The proposed new approach is straightforward to implement and scalable.},

If the correlation structure is unknown to the fusion method, conservative strategies are typically pursued. As such, the parameterization introduced by the ellipsoidal intersection method has been a novel approach to describe unknown correlations, though suitable values for these parameters with proven consistency have not been identified yet. In this article, an extension of ellipsoidal intersection is proposed that guarantees consistent fusion results in the presence of unknown common information. The bound used by the novel approach corresponds to computing an outer ellipsoidal bound on the intersection of inverse covariance ellipsoids. As a major advantage of this 	inverse covariance intersection method, fusion results prove to be more accurate than those provided by the well-known covariance intersection method.},

However, compared to particle filters, the PGF allows for much faster state estimation and circumvents the severe problem of particle degeneracy by gradually transforming its prior Gaussian distribution into a posterior one. In this paper, we further enhance the estimation quality and runtime of the PGF by proposing a semi-analytic measurement update applicable to likelihood functions that only depend on a subspace of the system state. In fact, the proposed semi-analytic measurement update is not limited to the PGF and can be used by any nonlinear state estimator as long as its state estimate is Gaussian, e.g., the Gaussian particle filter.},

    In general, the estimation quality depends on the amount of sensor data that can be exploited.
    However, missing observations do not necessarily impair the estimation quality but may also convey
    exploitable information on the system state. This type of information - noted as negative
    information - often requires specific measurement and noise models in order to take advantage of it.
    In this paper, a hybrid Kalman filter concept is employed that allows using both stochastic and
    set-membership representations of information. In particular, the latter representation is
    intended to account for negative information, which can often be easily described as a bounded
    set in the measurement space. Depending on the type of information, the filtering step of the

  a more sophisticated approach is employed where the particle motion is predicted with
  an area scan camera combined with a tracking algorithm. In addition, the influence of
  different operating parameters like particle shape or conveyor belt length on the

A novel sample-based KF is the Smart Sampling Kalman Filter (S²KF). It is based on deterministic Gaussian samples which are obtained from an offline optimization procedure. Although this sampling technique is quite effective, it does not preserve the point symmetry of the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we overcome this issue by extending the S²KF with a new point-symmetric Gaussian sampling scheme to improve its estimation quality. Moreover, we also improve the numerical stability of the sample computation. This allows us to accurately approximate thousand-dimensional Gaussian distributions using tens of thousands of optimally placed and equally weighted samples. We evaluate the new symmetric S²KF by computing higher-order moments of standard normal distributions and investigate the estimation quality of the S²KF when dealing with symmetric measurement equations. Additionally, extended object tracking based on many measurements per time step is considered. This high-dimensional estimation problem shows the advantage of the S²KF being able to use an arbitrary number of samples independent of the state dimension, in contrast to other state-of-the-art sample-based Kalman Filters. Finally, other estimators also relying on the S²KF’s Gaussian sampling technique, e.g., the Progressive Gaussian Filter (PGF), will benefit from the new point-symmetric sampling as well.},

	A solution to this issue has been found by developing

	Abstract = {Distributed and decentralized processing and fusion of sensor data are becoming increasingly important. In view of the Internet of Things and the vision of ubiquitous sensing, designing and implementing multisensor state estimation algorithm have already become a key issue. A network of interconnected sensor devices is usually characterized by the idea to process and collect data locally and independently on the sensor nodes. However, this does not imply that the data are independent of each other, and the state estimation algorithms have to address possible interdependencies so as to avoid erroneous data fusion results.
	Dependencies among local estimates generally can be traced back to common sensor information and common process noise. A wide variety of Kalman filtering schemes allow for the treatment of dependent data in centralized, distributed, and decentralized networks of sensor nodes, but making the right choice is itself dependent upon analyzing and weighing up the different advantages and disadvantages. This chapter discusses different strategies to identify and treat dependencies among Kalman filter estimates while pointing out advantages and challenges.},

  abstract = {An accurate Linear Regression Kalman Filter
    (LRKF) for nonlinear systems called Smart Sampling Kalman
    Filter (S²KF) is introduced. In order to get a better understanding
    of this new filter, a general introduction to Nonlinear Kalman
    Filters based on statistical linearization and LRKFs is given.
    The S²KF is based on a new low-discrepancy Dirac mixture
    approximation of Gaussian densities. This approximation com-
    prises an arbitrary number of optimally and deterministically
    placed samples in the relevant regions of the state space, so
    that the filter resolution can be adapted to either achieve high-
    quality results or to meet computational constraints. The S²KF
    contains the UKF with equally weighted samples as a special case
    when using the same amount of samples. With an increasing
    number of samples, the new filter converges to the (typically
    unfeasible) exact analytic statistical linearization. Hence, the
    S²KF can be seen as the ultimate generalization of all LRKFs
    such as the UKF, sigma-point filters, higher-order variants etc.,
    as it homogeneously covers the state space with a freely chosen
    number of samples. It is evaluated against state-of-the-art LRKFs

  abstract = {For designing sample sets for nonlinear Kalman
	filters, i.e., Linear Regression Kalman Filters (LRKFs), a new
	method is introduced for approximating Gaussian densities by
	discrete densities, so called Dirac Mixtures (DMs). This
	approximating DM should maintain the mean and some higher-
	order moments and should homogeneously cover the support
	of the original density. Homogeneous approximations require
	redundancy, which means there are more Dirac components than
	necessary for fulfilling the moment constraints. Hence, some
	sort of regularization is required as the solution is no longer
	unique. Two types of regularizers are possible: The first type
	ensures smooth approximations, e.g., in a maximum entropy
	sense. The second type we pursue here ensures closeness of
	the approximating density to the given Gaussian. As standard
	distance measures are typically not well defined for discrete
	densities on continuous domains, we focus on shifting the mass
	distribution of the approximating density as close to the true
	density as possible. Instead of globally comparing the masses as
	in a previous paper, the key idea is to characterize individual
	Dirac components by kernel functions representing the spread
	of probability mass that is appropriate at a given location. A
	distance measure is then obtained by comparing the deviation
	between the true density and the induced kernel density. As a
	result, the approximation problem is converted to an optimization
	problem as we now minimize the distance under the desired
	moment constraints.},

  abstract = {State fusion is a method for merging multiple estimates of the same
	state into a single fused estimate. Dealing with multiple estimates
	is one of the main concerns in distributed state estimation, where
	an estimated value of the desired state vector is computed in each
	node of a networked system. Most solutions for distributed state
	estimation currently available assume that every node computes an
	estimate of the (same) global state vector. This assumption is impractical
	for systems observing large-area processes, due to the sheer size
	of the process state. A more feasible solutions is one where each
	node estimates a part of the global state vector, allowing different
	nodes in the network to have overlapping state elements. Although
	such an approach should be accompanied by a corresponding state fusion
	method, existing solutions cannot be employed as they merely consider
	fusion of two different estimates with equal state representations.
	Therefore, an empirical solution is presented for fusing two state
	estimates that have partially overlapping state elements. A justification
	of the proposed fusion method is presented, along with an illustrative
	case study for observing the temperature profile of a large rod,

	As an addition, this paper describes how stabilized images are obtained

Sensor Network (WSN) is considered. Persons carry on-body sensor
nodes and move within a WSN. The location of each person is calculated
on this node and communicated through the network to a central data
sink for visualization. Applications of such a system could be found in
mass casualty events, firefighter scenarios, hospitals or retirement homes for example.
For the location estimation on the sensor node, three derivatives of the
Kalman Filter and a closed-form solution (CFS) are applied, compared,
and evaluated in a real-world scenario. A prototype 65-node ZigBee WSN
is implemented and data are collected in in- and outdoor environments
with differently positioned on-body nodes. The described estimators are
then evaluated off-line on the experimentally collected data.
The goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive real-world evaluation of methods for
person localization in a WSN based on received signal strength (RSS) range measurements.
It is concluded that person localization in in- and outdoor environments is possible
under the considered conditions with the considered filters. The compared methods
allow for suffciently accurate localization results and are robust against
inaccurate range measurements.},

inevitable. In this paper, we propose an approximation of the conditional
densities by wavelet expansions. This kind of representation allows a sparse
set of characterizing coefficients, especially for smooth or piecewise

algorithms operating on sparse vectors are applicable and thus, a good
trade-off between approximation quality and run-time can be achieved.
Moreover, due to its highly generic nature, it can be applied to a large
class of nonlinear systems with a high modeling accuracy. In particular, the
noise acting upon the system can be modeled by an arbitrary probability
distribution and can influence the system in any way.},

preferred direction and constrained in the other directions. By
using closed-loop haptic guidance instead of open-loop haptic

surgery system is required for complex cardiovascular interventions.
Methods: A heart surface motion tracking method is developed,
including a stochastic physics-based heart surface
model and an efficient reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm
uses the constraints provided by the model that exploits
the physical characteristics of the heart. The main advantage
of the model is that it is more realistic than most standard
heartmodels. Additionally, no explicit matching between the
measurements and the model is required. The application of
meshless methods significantly reduces the complexity of
physics-based tracking.
Results: Based on the stochastic physical model of the heart
surface, this approach considers the motion of the intervention
area and is robust to occlusions and reflections. The
tracking algorithm is evaluated in simulations and experiments
on an artificial heart. Providing higher accuracy than
the standardmodel-based methods, it successfully copes with
occlusions and provides high performance even when all
measurements are not available.
Conclusions: Combining the physical and stochastic description
of the heart surface motion ensures physically correct
and accurate prediction. Automatic initialization of the physics-based
cardiac motion tracking enables system evaluation
in a clinical environment.},

the real world. The gathered sensory information is typically uncertain in a stochastic

The prior knowledge contains all relevant background knowledge (e.g., concepts organized in ontologies)

Usually, for estimating the position of the object, the receiving times are
converted to a larger number of time differences of arrival (TDOA) in order
to eliminate the unknown offset. To avoid this conversion, the proposed
approach directly uses the receiving times. This is achieved by 1. determining the optimal offset from the redundant measurements in closed

the Kalman filter may then not only be applied to stochastic quantities, but also to unknown but bounded quantities.

modern sensors are able to supply several measurements from different scattering cen-
ters on the target object due to their high-resolution capability. As a consequence, it
becomes necessary to incorporate the target extent into the estimation procedure. This
paper introduces a new method for tracking the smallest enclosing rectangle of an ex-
tended object with an unknown shape. At each time step, a finite set of noisy position
measurements that stem from arbitrary, unknown measurement sources on the target
surface may be available. In contrast to common approaches, the presented approach
does not have to make any statistical assumptions on the measurement sources.},

arbitrary multi-dimensional probability density function by
means of a Dirac mixture density. Instead of an optimal
solution based on minimizing a global distance measure between
the true density and its approximation, a fast suboptimal
anytime procedure is proposed, which is based on sequentially
partitioning the state space and component placement by local
optimization. The proposed procedure adaptively covers the
entire state space with a gradually increasing resolution. It
can be efficiently implemented by means of a pre-allocated
tree structure in a straightforward manner. The resulting computational
complexity is linear in the number of components
and linear in the number of dimensions. This allows a large
number of components to be handled, which is especially useful
in high-dimensional state spaces.},

rigorous exploitation of strong mathematical models of distributed

phenomena, the individual sensor nodes can be localized by
only observing its local surrounding without the necessity of
heavy infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce two novel
approaches: (a) the polynomial system localization method
(PSL-method) and (b) the simultaneous reconstruction and
localization method (SRL-method). The first approach (PSLmethod)
is based on restating the mathematical model of the
distributed phenomenon in terms of a polynomial system.
These equations depend on both the state of the phenomenon
and the node locations. Solving the system of polynomials
for each individual sensor node directly leads to the desired
locations. The second approach (SRL-method) basically regards
the localization problem as a simultaneous state and parameter
estimation problem with the node locations as parameters. By
this means, the distributed phenomenon is reconstructed and
the individual nodes are localized in a simultaneous fashion.
In addition, within this framework the uncertainties in the
mathematical model and the measurements are considered.
The performance of the two different localization approaches
is demonstrated by means of simulation results.},

decentralized reconstruction of distributed phenomena, we propose a novel methodology consisting of
three steps: (a) conversion of the distributed phenomenon into a lumped-parameter system description,
(b) decomposition of the resulting system in order to map the description to the actual sensor network,
and (c) decomposition of the density representation leading to a decentralized estimation approach. The
main problem of a decentralized approach is that due to the propagation of local information through the

process in order to get correct and consistent estimation results. For that reason, we employ a robust
estimator (based on Covariance Bounds) for the local reconstruction update on each sensor node. By this
means, the individual sensor nodes are able to estimate the local state of the distributed phenomenon
using local estimates obtained and communicated by adjacent nodes only. The information about their
correlations is not stored in the sensor network.},

Bayesian prediction step for both linear and nonlinear
discrete-time dynamic systems using exponential densities with
polynomial exponents is proposed. The exact solution of the
prediction step is approximated by an exponential density
which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance. Compared to
other approaches, the user of this procedure can specify the
approximation quality by controlling the deviation between
the moments of the exact and the approximated solution.
Furthermore, this algorithm can also be used for the adaptation
of the order of the exponential densities either to improve the
approximation quality or to reduce the computational effort.},

the user's alter ego in the game. In this paper, we present a telepresence
interface for the first person game Quake III Arena, which gives the user
the impression of presence in the game and thus leads to identification
with his avatar. This is achieved by tracking the user's motion and using
this motion data as control input for the avatar. As the user is wearing a
head-mounted display and he perceives his actions affecting the virtual
environment, he fully immerses into the target environment. Without
further processing of the user's motion data, the virtual environment
would be limited to the size of the user's real environment, which is not

further processing of the motion data, the size of the remote
environment is limited to the size of the user environment.
Using the motion compression algorithm allows users to be
telepresent in large target environments while the size of the
user environment is limited. However, as a consequence of
the influence of standard motion compression on the user's
natural navigation, he tends to leave the desired path. This can
even lead to users leaving the user environment. We address
this problem by introducing controlled motion compression
which adds a feedback controller to motion compression.
This controller modifies the user's perception of the target
environment in such a way, that he is controlled on the path.},

  exhibitions, architecture, or industrial sites with a high degree of realism.
  While walking freely around in the user environment, the user sees the
  remote environment through the eyes of a remote mobile teleoperator.
  For that purpose, the user's motion is tracked and transferred to the
  teleoperator. Without additional processing of the motion data, the size of

  This paper proposes an extension of telepresent walking to arbitrarily large remote
  or virtual spaces based on compressing wide-area motion into the available user space.
  Motion compression is a novel approach and does not make use of scaling or
  walking-in-place metaphors. Rather, motion compression introduces some deviation of
  curvature between user motion and teleoperator motion. An optimization approach is
  used to find the user path of minimum curvature deviation with respect to a given
  predicted teleoperator path that fits inside the boundaries of the user environment.
  Turning angles and travel distances are mapped with a 1:1 ratio to provide the desired
  impression of realistic self-locomotion in the teleoperator's environment.
  The effects of the curvature deviation on inconsistent perception of
  locomotion are studied in two experiments.},

available that can be used for estimating the position of a cellular
phone. First, the timing advance (TA) gives an estimate
for the distance to the serving base station. Second, the signal
strengths (RXLEV) of neighbouring base stations can also be
interpreted as distance information. Both TA and RXLEV are
subject to measurement errors caused for example by shadowing,
reflections, and fast fading. Thus, a nonlinear set-theoretic
estimation technique based on pseudo ellipsoids is applied. The
uncertainty regions in the original space defined by the measurements
are transformed into a hyperspace of higher dimension
and described by pseudo ellipsoids. An approximation of
the set intersection of the pseudo ellipsoids can be calculated
recursively by a linear set-theoretic filter. The resulting pseudo
ellipsoid is transformed back into the original space, and the
position estimate is calculated as center of gravity of the resulting
uncertainty region. The algorithm is evaluated based on
the data of an extensive field trial in a rural area. Compared
to Cell ID, the accuracy is significantly increased by using TA

	virtual environments is presented, which frees the operator from being bound to
	a stationary workstation. The operator's unrestricted walking is available as input
	to the locomotion control of the teleoperator or the avatar. Hence, the operator
	uses proprioceptive perception of locomotion, which is required for navigation and
	wayfinding. To allow unrestricted local locomotion, the haptic interface moves
	along with the operator. This could be achieved by using a portable kinesthetic
	interface, which, however, is not capable of displaying large external forces.
	A mobile haptic interface, which actively follows the operator's locomotion.
	The corresponding locomotion platform is continuously positioned in such a way
	that maximum manipulability is guaranteed. In order to accomplish this under
	the kinematic and dynamic restrictions of the wheel-based platform, the operator's
	intention of locomotion is predicted. A prototype telepresence system for
	kinesthetic exploration of extended virtual environments has been designed
	according to the proposed paradigm, implemented, and tested.},

depending nonlinearly on x is considered. The
measurements are assumed to be taken sequentially
and are corrupted by unknown but bounded uncertainties.
For this uncertainty model, a systematic design
approach is introduced, which yields closed-form
expressions for the desired nonlinear estimates. The
estimates are recursively calculated and provide solution
sets X containing the feasible sets, i.e., the sets
of all x consistent with all the measurements available
and their associated bounds. The sets X are tight
upper bounds for the exact feasible sets and are in
general not convex and not connected. The proposed
design approach is versatile and the resulting nonlinear
filter algorithms are both easy to implement and
efficient.},

obtained by taking individual noise processes at different
time steps and between different noise processes
are completely unknown. New estimator equations
for solving this problem are derived in feedback form
for both the prediction step and for the filtering step
based on existing ideas known as covariance intersection.
Solutions are given for the most general case
of updating an N-dimensional state vector estimate
based on M-dimensional observations. Furthermore,
computationally efficient solutions for obtaining minimum
covariance estimates are derived to avoid numerical
