  abstract = {In an order-preserving encryption scheme, the encryption algorithm produces ciphertexts that preserve the order of their plaintexts. Order-preserving encryption schemes have been studied intensely in the last decade, and yet not much is known about the security of these schemes. Very recently, Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) introduced a generalization of order-preserving encryption, called order-revealing encryption, and presented a construction which achieves this notion with best-possible security. Because their construction relies on multilinear maps, it is too impractical for most applications and therefore remains a theoretical result.},

  abstract = {In this article, data cross-correlation in distributed sensor system is investigated via an order insensitive sequential fast covariance intersection fusion algorithm. Among the existing approaches, the common drawbacks are that the fusion results are sensitive to fusion orders and the computational burden is tremendous due to the optimization of multi-dimensional nonlinear cost function. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a sequential fast covariance intersection (SFCI) algorithm is presented. The new fusion coefficients can be calculated straightforward by taking the reciprocal of the trace of the inverse variances as local fusion coefficients and using an iterative process for fusion step to revise the coefficient weight. Note that the proposed fusion algorithm is consistent, and its accuracy is unrelated to the fusion order of the distributed system. Finally, real radar data and simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Among the possible approaches to tackling the problem of data incest in distributed data fusion networks, covariance intersection is a candidate that yields consistent estimates independent of network structure and any possible cross-correlation between local estimates. The corresponding weighting coefficients are usually chosen with the aim for a minimum trace or determinant of the resulting error variance matrix. A fast non-iterative algorithm exists that, to a certain extent, approximately solves this nonlinear optimization problem with extremely reduced numerical implementation effort. Yet, the obtained weighting coefficients do not depend on the relative orientation of the estimation error variance matrices which may lead to a degraded performance in certain applications. Hence, an improved fast covariance intersection algorithm is developed that comes with a slightly increased implementation effort while yielding significantly better estimation results in some cases and comparable results in all other ones. Simulation results confirm the postulated performance improvement.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, there has been significant interest in developing methods to search over encrypted data. In the case of range queries, a simple solution is to encrypt the contents of the database using an order-preserving encryption (OPE) scheme (i.e., an encryption scheme that supports comparisons over encrypted values). However, Naveed et al. (CCS 2015) recently showed that OPE-encrypted databases are extremely vulnerable to ``inference attacks.'' In this work, we consider a related primitive called order-revealing encryption (ORE), which is a generalization of OPE that allows for stronger security. We begin by constructing a new ORE scheme for small message spaces which achieves the ``best-possible'' notion of security for ORE. Next, we introduce a ``domain-extension'' technique and apply it to our small-message-space ORE. While our domain-extension technique does incur a loss in security, the resulting ORE scheme we obtain is more secure than all existing (stateless and non-interactive) OPE and ORE schemes which are practical. All of our constructions rely only on symmetric primitives. As part of our analysis, we also give a tight lower bound for OPE and show that no efficient OPE scheme can satisfy best-possible security if the message space contains just three messages. Thus, achieving strong notions of security for even small message spaces requires moving beyond OPE. Finally, we examine the properties of our new ORE scheme and show how to use it to construct an efficient range query protocol that is robust against the inference attacks of Naveed et al. We also give a full implementation of our new ORE scheme, and show that not only is our scheme more secure than existing OPE schemes, it is also faster: encrypting a 32-bit integer requires just 55 microseconds, which is more than 65 times faster than existing OPE schemes.},

Covariance intersection filtering provides a general framework for information fusion with incomplete knowledge about the signal sources since it yields consistent estimates for any degree of cross correlation. However, covariance intersection filtering requires optimization of a nonlinear cost function which is a significant drawback with respect to computational complexity. Therefore, a fast covariance intersection algorithm is developed and investigated based on simulation results.},
