  abstract = {Legacy encryption systems depend on sharing a key (public or private) among the peers involved in exchanging an encrypted message. However, this approach poses privacy concerns. The users or service providers with the key have exclusive rights on the data. Especially with popular cloud services, control over the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not shared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not necessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers, and cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end the relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a special kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance. Although this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over 30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data, was introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major achievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs to be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. Therefore, this survey focuses on HE and FHE schemes. First, we present the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which are important pillars for achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have become the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes, are presented. Furthermore, the implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also surveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed. This survey is intended to give a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and practitioners interested in knowing, applying, and extending the state-of-the-art HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.},

  abstract = {Distributed systems are ubiquitous in present-day technologies like smart cities. Such applications require decentralized control, which reduces the load on a single central party, but requires communication and data sharing between the participating agents. However, agents might not trust their peers with their private data. We propose secure multi-party computation schemes that ensure the private computation of the control updates of each agent, without leaking any other information about the states and controls of their neighbors. To this end, we make use of homomorphic encryption and private sum aggregation schemes. We analyze the conditions such that a dishonest agent cannot observe the rest of the network. Finally, we present implementations of the proposed schemes and showcase their efficiency.},

  abstract = {With the advent of cheap sensor technology, multisensor data fusion algorithms have been becoming a key enabler for efficient in-network processing of sensor data. The information filter, in particular, has proven useful due to its simple additive structure of the measurement update equations. In order to exploit this structure for an efficient in-network processing, each node in the network is supposed to locally process and combine data from its neighboring nodes. The aspired in-network processing, at first glance, prohibits efficient privacy-preserving communication protocols, and encryption schemes that allow for algebraic manipulations are often computationally too expensive. Partially homomorphic encryption schemes constitute far more practical solutions but are restricted to a single algebraic operation on the corresponding ciphertexts. In this paper, an additivehomomorphic encryption scheme is used to derive a privacypreserving implementation of the information filter where additive operations are sufficient to distribute the workload among the sensor nodes. However, the encryption scheme requires the floating-point data to be quantized, which impairs the estimation quality. The proposed filter and the implications of the necessary quantization are analyzed in a simulated multisensor tracking scenario.},

Order Preserving Encryption (OPE) and Order Revealing Encryption (ORE) are two important encryption schemes that have been proposed in this area. These schemes can provide very efficient query execution but at the same time may leak some information to adversaries. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive comparison among a number of important OPE and ORE schemes using a framework that we developed. We evaluate protocols that are based on these schemes as well. We analyze and compare them both theoretically and experimentally and measure their performance over database indexing and query evaluation techniques using not only execution time but also I/O performance and usage of cryptographic primitive operations. Our comparison reveals some interesting insights concerning the relative security and performance of these approaches in database settings. Furthermore, we propose a number of improvements for some of these scheme and protocols. Finally, we provide a number of suggestions and recommendations that can be valuable to database researchers and users.},

  abstract = {Distributed estimation has been an active research area since the late 1970's, starting with decentralized filtering and estimation for control of large scale systems. Early research focused on optimal fusion to reconstruct the best global estimate by de-correlating the local estimates to avoid double counting of information. This approach was extended to distributed estimation for general sensor networks using information graphs in the 1980's, with channel filter as a special case for acyclic networks. Track fusion for systems with process noise led to a general framework for linear estimate fusion given cross covariances in the 1990's. Fusion rules include maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori probability, and best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE). BLUE is based on a unified fusion model, which has been used to develop other fusion rules. In addition, covariance intersection handles situations where correlation information is completely unknown. Advances in sensing and communication hardware have resulted in low-cost wireless ad hoc sensor networks around 2000. These require robust distributed estimation algorithms such as consensus-based filters and diffusion-based filters, which have other performance criteria than estimation accuracy. There was recent resurgent interest in distributed estimation algorithms that handle process noise. Examples are distributed Kalman filters using pseudo estimates and distributed accumulated state density filters.},

In order to overcome these drawbacks, a sequential fast covariance intersection (SFCI) algorithm is presented. The new fusion coefficients can be calculated straightforward by taking the reciprocal of the trace of the inverse variances as local fusion coefficients and using an iterative process for fusion step to revise the coefficient weight. Note that the proposed fusion algorithm is consistent, and its accuracy is unrelated to the fusion order of the distributed system. Finally, real radar data and simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A fast non-iterative algorithm exists that, to a certain extent, approximately solves this nonlinear optimization problem with extremely reduced numerical implementation effort. Yet, the obtained weighting coefficients do not depend on the relative orientation of the estimation error variance matrices which may lead to a degraded performance in certain applications.

Smart and Vercauteren implemented the underlying ``somewhat homomorphic'' scheme, but were not able to implement the bootstrapping functionality that is needed to get the complete scheme to work. We show a number of optimizations that allow us to implement all aspects of the scheme, including the bootstrapping functionality.Our main optimization is a key-generation method for the underlying somewhat homomorphic encryption, that does not require full polynomial inversion. This reduces the asymptotic complexity from O\textasciitilde{}(n2.5)O\textasciitilde{}(n2.5)\textbackslash{}tilde\{O\}(n\^\{2.5\}) to O\textasciitilde{}(n1.5)O\textasciitilde{}(n1.5)\textbackslash{}tilde\{O\}(n\^\{1.5\}) when working with dimension-n lattices (and practically reducing the time from many hours/days to a few seconds/minutes). Other optimizations include a batching technique for encryption, a careful analysis of the degree of the decryption polynomial, and some space/time trade-offs for the fully-homomorphic scheme.We tested our implementation with lattices of several dimensions, corresponding to several security levels. From a ``toy'' setting in dimension 512, to ``small,'' ``medium,'' and ``large'' settings in dimensions 2048, 8192, and 32768, respectively. The public-key size ranges in size from 70 Megabytes for the ``small'' setting to 2.3 Gigabytes for the ``large'' setting. The time to run one bootstrapping operation (on a 1-CPU 64-bit machine with large memory) ranges from 30 seconds for the ``small'' setting to 30 minutes for the ``large'' setting.},

  abstract = {With the recent proliferation of service-oriented architectures (SOA), cloud computing technologies, and distributed-interconnected systems, distributed fusion is taking on a larger role in a variety of applicationsfrom environmental monitoring and crisis management to intelligent buildings and defense. Drawing on the work of leading experts around the world, Distributed Data Fusion for Network-Centric Operations examines the state of the art of data fusion in a distributed sensing, communications, and computing environment. Get Insight into Designing and Implementing Data Fusion in a Distributed Network Addressing the entirety of information fusion, the contributors cover everything from signal and image processing, through estimation, to situation awareness. In particular, the work offers a timely look at the issues and solutions involving fusion within a distributed network enterprise. These include critical design problems, such as how to maintain a pedigree of agents or nodes that receive information, provide their contribution to the dataset, and pass to other network components. The book also tackles dynamic data sharing within a network-centric enterprise, distributed fusion effects on state estimation, graph-theoretic methods to optimize fusion performance, human engineering factors, and computer ontologies for higher levels of situation assessment. A comprehensive introduction to this emerging field and its challenges, the book explores how data fusion can be used within grid, distributed, and cloud computing architectures. Bringing together both theoretical and applied research perspectives, this is a valuable reference for fusion researchers and practitioners. It offers guidance and insight for those working on the complex issues of designing and implementing distributed, decentralized information fusion.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, there has been significant interest in developing methods to search over encrypted data. In the case of range queries, a simple solution is to encrypt the contents of the database using an order-preserving encryption (OPE) scheme (i.e., an encryption scheme that supports comparisons over encrypted values). However, Naveed et al. (CCS 2015) recently showed that OPE-encrypted databases are extremely vulnerable to ``inference attacks.'' In this work, we consider a related primitive called order-revealing encryption (ORE), which is a generalization of OPE that allows for stronger security. We begin by constructing a new ORE scheme for small message spaces which achieves the ``best-possible'' notion of security for ORE. Next, we introduce a ``domain-extension'' technique and apply it to our small-message-space ORE. While our domain-extension technique does incur a loss in security, the resulting ORE scheme we obtain is more secure than all existing (stateless and non-interactive) OPE and ORE schemes which are practical. All of our constructions rely only on symmetric primitives. As part of our analysis, we also give a tight lower bound for OPE and show that no efficient OPE scheme can satisfy best-possible security if the message space contains just three messages. Thus, achieving strong notions of security for even small message spaces requires moving beyond OPE. Finally, we examine the properties of our new ORE scheme and show how to use it to construct an efficient range query protocol that is robust against the inference attacks of Naveed et al. We also give a full implementation of our new ORE scheme, and show that not only is our scheme more secure than existing OPE schemes, it is also faster: encrypting a 32-bit integer requires just 55 microseconds, which is more than 65 times faster than existing OPE schemes.},

Either it is too difficult to maintain and track the information required to perform fusion optimally, or too much information is discarded to obtain informative fusion results. A well-known solution is Covariance Intersection, which may provide too conservative fusion results. A less conservative alternative is discussed in this paper, and generalizations are proposed in order to apply it to a wide class of fusion problems. The Inverse Covariance Intersection algorithm is about finding the maximum possible common information shared by the estimates to be fused. A bound on the possibly shared common information is derived and removed from the fusion result in order to guarantee consistency. It is shown that the conditions required for consistency can be significantly relaxed, and also other causes of correlations, such as common process noise, can be treated.},

There are a wide variety of algorithms catering to different applications and requiring different degrees of knowledge about the other nodes involved. One recently developed algorithm is the distributed Kalman filter (DKF), which assumes that all knowledge about the measurements, except the measurements themselves, are known to all nodes. If this condition is met, the DKF allows deriving the optimal estimate if all information is combined in one node at an arbitrary time step. In this paper, we present an information form of the distributed Kalman filter (IDKF) that allows the use of explicit system inputs at the individual nodes while still yielding the same results as a centralized Kalman filter.},

This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be ``signed'' using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in ``electronic mail'' and ``electronic funds transfer'' systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d {$\equiv$} 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

Current fusion methods of two estimates tend to bypass the mutual information and directly optimize the fused estimate. Moreover, both the mean and covariance of the fused estimate are fully determined by optimizing the covariance only. In contrast to that, this paper proposes a novel fusion method in which the mutual information results in an additional estimate, which defines a mutual mean and covariance. Both variables are derived from the two initial estimates. The mutual covariance is used to optimize the fused covariance, while the mutual mean optimizes the fused mean. An example of decentralized state estimation, where the proposed fusion method is applied, shows a reduction in estimation error compared to the existing alternatives.},

An optimal fusion requires the knowledge of the correct correlations between locally obtained estimates. The naive and intractable way of calculating the correct correlations would be to exchange information about every processed measurement between all nodes. Instead, we propose to obtain the correct correlations by keeping and processing a small set of deterministic samples on each node in parallel to the actual local state estimation. Sending these samples in addition to the local state estimate to the fusion center allows for correctly reconstructing the desired correlations between all estimates. In doing so, each node does not need any information about measurements processed on other nodes. We show the optimality of the proposed method by means of tracking an extended object in a multi-camera network.},

Based on this optimal fusion criterion, a general multi-sensor optimal information fusion decentralized Kalman filter with a two-layer fusion structure is given for discrete time linear stochastic control systems with multiple sensors and correlated noises. The first fusion layer has a netted parallel structure to determine the cross covariance between every pair of faultless sensors at each time step. The second fusion layer is the fusion center that determines the optimal fusion matrix weights and obtains the optimal fusion filter. Comparing it with the centralized filter, the result shows that the computational burden is reduced, and the precision of the fusion filter is lower than that of the centralized filter when all sensors are faultless, but the fusion filter has fault tolerance and robustness properties when some sensors are faulty. Further, the precision of the fusion filter is higher than that of each local filter. Applying it to a radar tracking system with three sensors demonstrates its effectiveness.},
